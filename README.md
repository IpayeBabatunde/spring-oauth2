OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access protected resources on behalf of a user without requiring the user’s credentials. This is achieved through the use of access tokens, which are issued by an OAuth provider and used by third-party applications to access the user’s resources.

Spring Boot is a popular framework for building web applications in Java. It provides a powerful set of tools for building secure and scalable web applications, and is well-suited for implementing OAuth 2.0.

In this blog post, we will go through the steps required to implement OAuth 2.0 using Spring Boot. We will use the Spring Security OAuth 2.0 framework to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization and authentication.

Before we start, let’s first go through the OAuth 2.0 flow to get a better understanding of how it works.

Overview of OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user. It uses access tokens to provide access to resources, which are obtained after successful authentication. There are four roles in OAuth 2.0: Resource Owner, Client, Authorization Server, and Resource Server.

Resource Owner: The user who owns the resource that is being accessed by the client.
Client: The application that is requesting access to the resource on behalf of the user.
Authorization Server: The server that issues access tokens to the client after successful authentication of the user.
Resource Server: The server that holds the resource that is being accessed by the client.
OAuth 2.0 Flow
The OAuth 2.0 flow involves the following steps:

User requests access to a protected resource from a third-party application.
The third-party application redirects the user to an OAuth provider to obtain an access token.
The user logs in to the OAuth provider and grants permission to the third-party application to access the protected resource.
The OAuth provider issues an access token to the third-party application.
The third-party application uses the access token to access the protected resource on behalf of the user.
Now that we have an understanding of the OAuth 2.0 flow, let’s move on to implementing it using Spring Boot.
